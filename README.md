# 100 Days of Code Challenge

Welcome to my 100 Days of Code Challenge repository! ðŸš€

## About the Challenge

The 100 Days of Code Challenge is a self-improvement journey aimed at enhancing coding skills through daily practice. The core idea is simple: commit to coding for at least one hour every day for 100 consecutive days. This challenge encourages consistent learning, the development of problem-solving skills, and the creation of new projects or the improvement of existing ones.

## Goals

- Improve coding skills through daily practice
- Build and complete various projects
- Learn new programming languages, frameworks, and tools
- Document the journey and progress
- Engage with the coding community for support and feedback

## Structure

This repository is organized as follows:

- **Daily Logs**: Documenting daily progress, challenges, and learnings.
- **Projects**: Code for the projects I work on during the challenge.
- **Resources**: Useful links, tutorials, and references used throughout the challenge.

## Daily Logs

Each day, I will update the daily log with my activities, learnings, and any code snippets or projects I worked on. The logs are stored in the `logs` directory, with a separate markdown file for each day.

## Projects

All project-related code and files will be stored in the `projects` directory. Each project will have its own subdirectory containing the source code, documentation, and other relevant files.

## Resources

A collection of resources, including tutorials, articles, and documentation that I found helpful, will be listed in the `resources` directory. This section will also include any notes or summaries of key concepts.

## How to Use This Repository

Feel free to browse through the logs to see my daily progress. You can also explore the projects to see what I have built and how I have approached different challenges. If you are also participating in the 100 Days of Code Challenge, I hope this repository serves as a source of inspiration and motivation.
